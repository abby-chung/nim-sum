# Nim Sum

> A personalized financial planning map to help achieve financial freedom.

We are all struggling with money. What is the best way to understand one's own finance? How to map out one's own financial plan?

Taking control of your own financial management can be exhausting, but it is a way to better understand yourself.

What I want to accomplish through this project is to create a blueprint for anyone who is looking to customize their own ways of financial management and is not afraid of taking the time to figure it out.

The purpose of this application/blueprint is to identify where all my money comes and goes, customize personal financial plan based on lifestyle, and thus easier to target the goals of one's personal savings and to figure out a future life plan.

## Installing / Getting started

I am still not sure with the minimal setup you need to get for nim-sum up & running.

```shell
packagemanager install nim-sum
nim-sum start
nim-sum "Do something!"  # prints "Not sure"
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above. (But I haven't figured out yet)

Give me some time, I will update this part.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.
(For now, I don't think I have.)

## Developing

Here is how you can start adding changes to the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abby-chung/nim-sum.git
